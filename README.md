# Pulse-Width-Modulation
PWM implementation in FPGA.

Based on the clock divider given in the testbech, the code generates two separate clocks.
It features different blocks for creating output clocks dependent on the values of your input clock divider.
Even and odd numbers are possible for the clock divder.
A PWM is generated using this output clock.


The simulation was run on zedboard.
