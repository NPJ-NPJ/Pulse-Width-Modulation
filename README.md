# Pulse-Width-Modulation
PWM implementation in FPGA./newline
The code generates  two different clocks based on the clock divider mentioned in the testbech. 
It has separate blocks for generating outputs clocks based on your input clock divider values. 
The clock divder can have even and odd values. 
Using this outpu clock a PWM is generated.
